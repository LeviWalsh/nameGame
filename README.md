# Name Game

Repository for a iOS game I made that displays different pictures of members in Mobile Developers of Berkeley and with four options to select who it is.

A correct answer highlights the name in green and increments your current score by one while an incorrect answer or an answer that isn't faster than the 5 second counter resets your score and highlights the name in red. The statistics page keeps track of your all time high score and the response to your previous three answers.
